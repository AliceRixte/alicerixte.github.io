  In this article, we provide a generalization of turtle graphics that can be specialized to create various domain-specific languages. In particular, we provide two specializations of our language: the first one produces Bézier paths and the second one combines and manipulates these paths for vector graphics. Additionally, we introduce a syntax that adds absolute positioning to the relative positioning of turtle graphics. We demonstrate how a systematic way to extend the turtle’s state allows generic equational reasoning on programming languages similar to turtle graphics as well as a rich way to specify languages for media arts
